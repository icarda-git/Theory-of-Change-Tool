# Theory of Change (ToC) Tool
The Theory of Change Tool aims to formalize and streamline the creation of Nested ToCs for CGIAR activities at different levels of maturity.

It is based on the CGIAR ToC Guidance Directive and builds on the ToC Data Model informing the structure of its knowledge base.

The tool is built as a web application, with clearly decoupled frontend and backend components.
The communication between the components is realised via a broad set of REST API calls, as presented in the [relevant document](TOC-API.pdf).
The calls are meant for internal usage by the tool but can be used in the future to expose information in other applications.

Further documentation that contributes to the understanding of the API organisation is provided in the accompanying [Data Model Summary Report](TOC Tool Data Model.pdf) and the [online documentation](http://documentation.toc.scio.services/) for the [ontology](toc.owl) that represents the model using W3C Semantic Web standards and specifications.
